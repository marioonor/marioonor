# 👋 Hello, I'm Mario Onor

"Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate and driven **Junior Java Developer** with a solid foundation in **cybersecurity** and over 1.5 years of hands-on experience. My journey involves securing cloud infrastructure and building robust backend systems.

I'm actively focused on developing high-quality applications using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Angular**, as demonstrated by my projects like the GRC Evidence Collection Tool and To-Do List Web Application. My background in cybersecurity provides a unique advantage in creating secure, resilient software, as I understand system vulnerabilities and defensive programming practices.

Eager to contribute to a dynamic development team, I'm dedicated to continuous learning and applying my skills to build innovative solutions. Let's connect and build something impactful!"
